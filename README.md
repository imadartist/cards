# PROJECT TITLE
"Luck of the Draw"

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Playing cards are meant to be motion. By introducing animation to my pen & ink drawings of playing cards, these pieces become more dimensional and have the ability to draw people into the art of everyday design, even on a standard pack of cards. Animation allows the viewer to experience the art in a way that evokes how its real-world inspiration is viewed.

# ARTIST STATEMENT
The best word to describe my art style is "curious". As I have developed my pen & ink and watercolor style for the past few years, I have approached every artistic principle as wet concrete and let my art get messy as I dip it into question. Rather than approaching color, perspective, or composition, and molding my art to its presuppositions, I deconstruct an idea, play with its elements, and put it back together wearing the perfume of my artistic personality. Taking my art into the digital space and transforming it in code is a new frontier of curiosity for me, but I have enjoyed seeing how my audience also interacts with my pieces with a new curiousity as they manipulate my images.
